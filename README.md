# VaporRyder

Vapor Ryder is a game idea that orginated from an Orlando Inter Galactic Space Jam. The game couldn't be finished due to the programmer dropping out at the end of the first day. I took the audio assets created by Kyle Williams and the art assets created by myself and programmed the game myself using C#.

Vapor Ryder is a retro-styled space game of Marco Polo. Find the exit by following the sound of the beacon and the direction its light hits you while avoiding asteroids and space debris. Large asteroids explode on impact with other hazards splitting into smaller chunks. Satellite energy waves deplete your available fuel. Black holes swallow objects and teleport them to a random location. Levels increase in difficulty procedurally as you advance.

All scripting done in C#

All Art Assets created by myself.


# Vapor Ryder was created with Unity version 2017.2.0
